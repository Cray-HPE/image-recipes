# Shasta Image Recipes

This repository maintains Cray developed image recipes for building bootable and 
non-bootable images to be used for Shasta based systems.

### Prerequisites

To build the recipes in this project, you will need to have access to a system
or virtual machine with the appropriate image building tools installed. It is
expected that, over time, recipes for a variety of different image building tools
will be available and maintained. Recipes for a particular image tool (kiwi-ng,
for example) will be kept under a common directory.
