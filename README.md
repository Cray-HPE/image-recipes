# Shasta Image Recipes

This repository maintains Cray developed image recipes for building bootable and 
non-bootable images to be used for Shasta based systems.

## CSM / SLES version files

The source of truth for CSM and SLES versions are:
* `csm_major.version`
* `csm_minor.version`
* `sles_release.version`
* `sles_sp.version`

## Prerequisites

To build the recipes in this project, you will need to have access to a system
or virtual machine with the appropriate image building tools installed. It is
expected that, over time, recipes for a variety of different image building tools
will be available and maintained. Recipes for a particular image tool (kiwi-ng,
for example) will be kept under a common directory.

## Build Helpers
This repo uses some build helpers from the 
[cms-meta-tools](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/cms-meta-tools) repo. See that repo for more details.

## Local Builds
If you wish to perform a local build, you will first need to clone or copy the contents of the
cms-meta-tools repo to `./cms_meta_tools` in the same directory as the `Makefile`. When building
on github, the cloneCMSMetaTools() function clones the cms-meta-tools repo into that directory.

For a local build, you will also need to manually write the .version, .docker_version (if this repo
builds a docker image), and .chart_version (if this repo builds a helm chart) files. When building
on github, this is done by the setVersionFiles() function.

## Versioning
The version of this repo is generated dynamically at build time by running the version.py script in 
cms-meta-tools. The version is included near the very beginning of the github build output. 

In order to make it easier to go from an artifact back to the source code that produced that artifact,
a text file named gitInfo.txt is added to Docker images built from this repo. For Docker images,
it can be found in the / folder. This file contains the branch from which it was built and the most
recent commits to that branch. 

For helm charts, a few annotation metadata fields are appended which contain similar information.

For RPMs, a changelog entry is added with similar information.
